## Machine-learning-R

There are 4 projects for university ranking
1. Data preparation and Visualization
2. Predictive Modeling of world university ranking (Random forest, Conditional Inference Tree, C 4.5, Rule-based classifier, Linear Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Network and Gradient boosting decision tree)
3. Association Rule Mining
4. Cluster Analysis (k-means, hierarchical clustering, Density-based Clustering, Partitioning Around Medoids(pam) and Gaussian Mixture Models. )
